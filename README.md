# bash-scripts
repository of my bash scripts.

currently includes **6** scripts.

* **sync.sh** - updates an arch linux or arch based system and downloads some basic tools that i use
  * *sync_documented.sh* - a variation of sync with comments.
* **install_neofetch.sh** - a script to install the required xcode tools for homebrew, homebrew itself, and neofetch for a macos machine. includes comments.

* **secure_backup.sh** - a bash script that creates an archive of a user's target backup directory, encrypts it, and then sends it over the internet.

* **simple_ssh.sh** - a script to make connecting via OpenSSH just a bit more friendly.

* **apt_update.sh** - because updating apt-based systems is shit.

*previous copies of these scripts are kept in the previous branch. this is in case a mistake is made and isn't caught before being pushed to master.*
