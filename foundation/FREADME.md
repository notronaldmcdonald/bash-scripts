# Foundation Project

## A project to unify my scripts. Common variables and functions, and maybe a few niche ones.
*Maybe you'll find something here useful?*

**Files**

* *foundation-base* - the core of the foundation project. 16 color + bold text formatting, automatic update function.

* *foundation-extra* - additional features. 256 color support + other text formatting, fpkgr, password storing.

* *FREADME.md* - what you're reading right now.

* *upstream-targets* - a file that contains the list of curl commands to download foundation files.

* *../live/foundation/buildinfo* - a reference file containing version info for the latest release.

**What to do with it?**

It is completely free, so do as you wish! I personally believe that this is a better option than putting the substitutions for color
at the top of all your scripts. Known to support bash and zsh, notify me if anything is wrong. Alternatively, submit your own code!
