# bash-scripts
repository of my bash scripts.

currently includes **9** scripts.

* **sync.sh** - updates an arch linux or arch based system and downloads some basic tools that i use
  * *sync_documented.sh* - a variation of sync with comments.
* **install_neofetch.sh** - a script to install the required xcode tools for homebrew, homebrew itself, and neofetch for a macos machine. includes comments.

* **secure_backup.sh** - a bash script that creates an archive of a user's target backup directory, encrypts it, and then sends it over the internet.

* **simple_ssh.sh** - a script to make connecting via OpenSSH just a bit more friendly.
  *  *simple_ssh_documented.sh* - same thing as above, but with comments.
* **apt_update.sh** - because updating apt-based systems is shit.

# malware

* **toptenmostdangerouslinuxcommands** - literally deletes root. this is the shittiest thing ever.

* **why** - i wrote this at 1am

*the dev branch is used when working with git. this is to make sure master doesn't get overwritten, as it typically has the cleanest working versions of all of my scripts*

*the previous branch contains the previous versions of every script.*
